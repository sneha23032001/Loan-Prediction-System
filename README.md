**Loan Prediction System**

**Overview**

This project aims to automate and streamline the loan approval process using machine learning techniques. The system predicts whether a loan should be approved or not based on historical loan data.

**Features**

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

**Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features and transforming data for model training.

**Machine Learning Models**: Utilizing algorithms to predict loan approvals.

**Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

**Technologies Used**

**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/sneha23032001/loan-prediction-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd loan-prediction-system

3. Install the required libraries:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


**Usage**

1. Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the dataset.

   python data_preprocessing.py

2. Execute the feature_engineering.py script to perform feature engineering.

   python feature_engineering.py

3. Run the model_training.py script to train the machine learning model.
 
   python model_training.py


4. Execute the model_evaluation.py script to evaluate the model performance.

   python model_evaluation.py
